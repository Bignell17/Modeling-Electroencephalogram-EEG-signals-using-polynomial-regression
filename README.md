Polynomial Regression

A Regression Model that described the relationship between several ‘simulated’ brain electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was created. The steps were to first perform an initial exploratory data analysis, by investigating time series plots, distribution of each EEG signal, and the correlation between different inputs. Then different models were created using methods like Least Square and ABC Rejection algorithm and compared using metrics like Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion.
